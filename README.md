Topic Modelling and Regression to predict value of patents.  
  
[This](https://github.com/giraldon/patent-regression/blob/master/Patents_Topics_Regression_Desktop.ipynb) is a notebook which runs through the project step-by-step as a whole.  
  
Initially, my goal was to create a model which would predict the value of a given patent, by building a regression model around ground-truth values which were obtained from [this paper](https://github.com/giraldon/patent-regression/blob/master/SSRN-id2193068.pdf).  
However, I eventually found that I could not correlate the patent metadata strongly enough with the ground-truth values to justify predicting the value of any given patent.  
  
Despite this, the project was very useful for visualizing which companies have put out the most valuable patents, and comparing across companies. Furthermore, I was able to determine the most valuable patent topics, to a certain degree, which allowed for an easy visual comparison.  
  
The presentation containing all of the visuals I created in tableau, as well as a general narrative is available [here](https://github.com/giraldon/patent-regression/blob/master/Patent_design%20(2).pdf)
